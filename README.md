# SceneClassificationCNN
This uses the Scene Classification Kaggle dataset. The task is to identify which kind of scene can the image be categorized into:
0: Buildings, 1: Forests, 2: Mountains, 3: Glacier, 4: Sea, 5: Street.

# Data Preprocessing
Be sure to download the Kaggle dataset named Scene Classification. Then with train.csv and test.csv in the parent directory, run the file named SaveToNumpy.py to preprocess and
save the preprocessed data to numpy arrays. This will be easier to load for running files that train and test different models.
